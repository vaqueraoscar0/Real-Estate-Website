## Overview

The Location-Based Real Estate Website project is a full stack web application that combines Django and React Js to create a platform for showcasing real estate listings. The website utilizes Material UI, a React library for building UI components, to design and style the frontend. Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, is integrated with React using React-Leaflet to add a geographic aspect to the project.

The PostgreSQL database used in this project is made spatially aware by adding the PostGIS extension. This allows for both regular and spatial queries, including geometric information such as distance calculations.

User authentication is implemented using the Djoser library, enabling users to add, delete, or update property listings from the frontend. Error handling for both client-side and server-side errors in forms is also covered.
